# octobercms-plugin-example
This is a project I have developed in October CMS /Laravel. It's an appointment management App. Basically a user (customer) can make an appointment with an engineer to do a job and the engineer must have the qualification do to the job. I signed an NDA about the project so I can only show some sample code.    These are 3 sample models from the project: the Appointment class, the Job class and  the Profile class.
